This release has got a significant number of changes sine the last release
so is probably prone to a few bugs.

*** NOTE *** NOTE *** NOTE *** NOTE *** NOTE *** NOTE *** NOTE *** NOTE ***

My intention is to attempt to make this package so that it can be used in
a non-blocking manner. This may, in future, cause the interface to change.

Although I will try to limit the impact of this I cannot gaurantee that
future releases will be 100% compatable.
