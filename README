This distribution 1.18_1 is identical to 1.18 except that IO::Socket has been
renamed as Net::Socket. This is because the IO::* modules are having a serious
re-fit.

This is the README file for Net::FTP

Net::FTP is a perl5 package which implements the client side of
a FTP connection as per RFC959

In order to use this package you will need Perl version 5.001m or
better. The File::Listing package can be found in the libwww distribution.
To use the complete libwww distribution you require 5.002, If you
do not have 5.002 File::Listing can be extracted from libwww and will work
with 5.001

See lib/Net/FTP.pm for details of the library. See ChangeLog for recent
changes. POD style documentation is included in all/most modules and scripts.
You should be able to use the 'perldoc' utility to extract documentation
from these files.

Before building this extension you will require the following modules. The 
building of the Makefile will abort if you do not have the required versions.
All of these modules should be avaliable from CPAN (see README.CPAN for 
more information)

   Socket v1.03

You install the library by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

You can edit the configuration section of Makefile.PL to select which
programs to install in addition to the library itself.  If you don't
want to install any programs at all then make the initial Makefile with:

   perl Makefile.PL -l

When reporting bugs/problems please, if possible, include a transcript of
a run with the Debug option turned on.

This release has got a significant number of changes sine the last release
so is probably prone to a few bugs.

*** NOTE *** NOTE *** NOTE *** NOTE *** NOTE *** NOTE *** NOTE *** NOTE ***

My intention is to attempt to make this package so that it can be used in
a non-blocking manner. This may, in future, cause the interface to change.

Although I will try to limit the impact of this I cannot gaurantee that
future releases will be 100% compatable.
